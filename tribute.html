    <h2>About of elon musk</h2>
    <p>Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
        Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity
        in 2016, and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration. Early Life Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so
        lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing. At about the time of his parentsâ€™ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and
        when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.

    <h1>About starlink</h1>
    <h2>HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS ACROSS THE GLOBE</h2>
    <p id="img-caption">With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet, and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive,
        or completely unavailable. Starlink is targeting service in the Northern U.S. and Canada in 2020, rapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021.</p>
    <p id="tribute-info">Starlink is a satellite constellation being constructed by SpaceX[2][3] to provide satellite Internet access.[4][5] The constellation will consist of thousands of mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), working in combination with
        ground transceivers. SpaceX also plans to sell some of the satellites for military,[6] scientific, or exploratory purposes.[7] The SpaceX satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington houses the Starlink research, development, manufacturing,
        and on-orbit control operations. The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in May 2018 to be about US$10 billion.[8] Product development began in 2015, with the first two prototype
        test-flight satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation occurred in May 2019 when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[2][9] As of 2020, SpaceX
        is launching 60 satellites at a time, aiming to deploy 1,584 of the 260 kilograms (570 lb) spacecraft to provide near-global service by late 2021 or 2022.[10] SpaceX is targeting a private beta service in the Northern U.S. and Canada by August
        2020 with a public beta following in November 2020.[11] Concerns have been raised about the long-term danger of space debris resulting from placing thousands of satellites in orbits above 600 kilometres (370 mi)[12][13] and a possible impact on
        astronomy,[14] although the Starlink satellite orbits were lowered to 550 kilometres (340 mi) or below[15] and SpaceX is reportedly attempting to solve the latter issue. On Starlink 2, one of the satellites has an experimental coating to make
        it less reflective, and thus impact ground-based astronomical observations less.[16] A June 2020 launch included one satellite with an experimental sunshade.[17] On 15 October 2019, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission submitted filings
        to the International Telecommunication Union on SpaceX's behalf to arrange spectrum for 30,000 additional Starlink satellites to supplement the 12,000 Starlink satellites already approved by the FCC</p>
